Deprecated in favour of [windows-single-header](https://github.com/SollyCB/windows-c-single-header) - note that the name does not mean that it is Windows only, I just started programming it using Windows.
I started this file when I had less programming experience, so lots of it is ugly. Eventually, I plan to remake the windows-single-header version when I feel that it too is too crufty and ugly. I already
have a strong desire to rewrite it using the coding style used in the [raddebugger](https://github.com/EpicGamesExt/raddebugger), because that repo is so beautiful.

# Single Header C Library

For when I need a little tool, isn't it...

(Its also sometimes useful to have a set of strings to work on, hence 'names.c')
